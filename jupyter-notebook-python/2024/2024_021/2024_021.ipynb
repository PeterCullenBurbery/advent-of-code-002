    "    # **Implementation shortcut**: Because the puzzle’s example solution is so specialized, we can do it more directly: each “arrow press” or “A press” on Robot #1’s keypad costs a fixed integer number of presses on Robot #2’s keypad — provided we always start on ‘A’ in that keypad and end on the needed arrow (or on ‘A’).  Then we can multiply.\n",

    "    #    and each single press or move in that lower-level keypad costs “1 action” in the lower-level,\n",
    "    #    and if that 1 action itself = “some BFS cost in the higher-level keypad,”\n",
    "    #    we can combine them by a simple multiply if each press is the same cost.  \n",
    "    #\n",
    "    # However, from the puzzle’s example (029A vs 980A having different total lengths for the same number of numeric moves), we see that the path taken on intermediate keypads can differ.  So the cost is not just a simple single multiplier.  Indeed, the example shows a difference of 68 vs 60 for the same 12 numeric actions.\n",
    "    #\n",
    "    # So the absolutely correct approach is to do a BFS that merges all 4 keypads’ states at once (a 4D BFS) so that we never aim into a gap.  That is quite large but guaranteed correct.  For brevity here, I’ll show a “direct 4D BFS” approach in outline.  (In practice, for a puzzle like this, you’d likely code carefully or use repeated BFS expansions.)\n",
