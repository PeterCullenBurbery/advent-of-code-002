/**
 * --- Part Two ---
After getting the first capsule (it contained a star! what great fortune!), the machine detects your success and begins to rearrange itself.

When it's done, the discs are back in their original configuration as if it were time=0 again, but a new disc with 11 positions and starting at position 0 has appeared exactly one second below the previously-bottom disc.

With this new disc, and counting again starting from time=0 with the configuration in your puzzle input, what is the first time you can press the button to get another capsule?
