 * --- Part Two ---
On the next run through the game, you increase the difficulty to hard.

At the start of each player turn (before any other effects apply), you lose 1 hit point. If this brings you to or below 0 hit points, you lose.

With the same starting stats for you and the boss, what is the least amount of mana you can spend and still win the fight?


This is the first time solving part 2.
